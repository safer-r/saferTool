\description{
Compare two 2D datasets of the same class or not. Check and report in a list if the 2 datasets have:

- same class
- same type
- common row names
- common column names
- same row number
- same column number
- potential identical rows between the 2 datasets
- potential identical columns between the 2 datasets

WARNINGS

The results in:

$any.id.row,

$same.row.pos1,

$same.row.pos2,

$same.row.match1,

$same.row.match2,

$any.id.col, 

$same.col.pos1,

$same.col.pos2,

$same.col.match1,

$same.col.match2,

$identical.content,

$identical

Does not take into account the mode and type (integer, double, character, etc.) of the matrix, data frame and table content. Indeed, comparisons are performed after conversion of the content into characters. This allows the 2 by 2 comparisons of data frame rows. However, the same mode and same type information is provided with the $same.mode and $same.type result, which is convenient when dealing with matrices and tables. But the different modes and types between column of a data frame is never considered. Thus, be careful when concluding that columns of two different data frames are the same, because the values can be identical but not the mode or type (integer in the first data frame column, and double in the second data frame column, for instance).


"TOO BIG FOR EVALUATION" returned in $same.row.pos1, $same.row.pos2, $same.row.match1 and $same.row.match2 when nrow(data1) * nrow(data2) > 1e6 and $any.id.row is returned NULL.


"TOO BIG FOR EVALUATION" returned in $same.col.pos1, $ame.col.pos2, $same.col.match1 and $same.col.match2 when ncol(data1) * ncol(data2) > 1e6 and $any.id.col is returned NULL.
