### Datasets

```{r}
vec1 <- -1:3 # vector of integers
vec2 <- c(1:3, NA) # vector of integers with NA
vec3 <- c(1:3, Inf) # vector of integers with Inf
vec4 <- 1:3 / 3 # vector of proportions
vec5 <- c(1, 2, NA, -Inf) # vector of integers but stored as "double", with NA and Inf
log1 <- c(TRUE, FALSE, NA) # logical vector with NA
log2 <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) # logical vector                    
cpx <- as.complex(vec1) # complex vector
mat1 <- matrix(vec1) # 1D matrix of integers
mat2 <- matrix(vec5) # 1D matrix of integers, NA and Inf
mat3 <- matrix(log1) # 1D matrix of logical values
mat4 <- matrix(log2) # 1D matrix of logical values and NA
fac1 <- factor(vec5) # 1D factor
tab1 <- table(fac1) # 1D table
```
