### Datasets

```{r}
vec1 <- -1:3 # vector of integers
vec2 <- 1:3 / 3 # vector of proportions
vec3 <- c(1, 2, NA, -Inf) # vector of integers but stored as "double", with NA and Inf
vec4 <- "pearson" # vector of characters
vec5 <- c("a", "b","a", NA) # vector of characters with NA
cpx <- as.complex(1) # complex
mat1 <- matrix(vec1) # 1D matrix of integers
```

<br>

### Datasets info

```{r}
vec1 # vector of integers
vec2 # vector of proportions
vec3 # vector of integers but stored as "double", with NA
vec4 # vector of characters
vec5 # vector of characters with NA
mat1 # 1D matrix of integers
```
<br>

### Simple examples

```{r}
info(data = vec1) # vector of integers
info(data = vec2) # vector of proportions
info(data = vec3) # vector of integers but stored as "double", with NA and Inf
info(data = vec4) # vector of characters
info(data = vec5) # vector of characters with NA
info(data = mat1) # 1D matrix of integers
info(data = mat2) # 2D matrix of floats with NA
info(data = df1) # data.frame
```

### Argument na.rm
```{r}
info(
    data = vec1, 
    n = 1, # number of element to display per compartment of the output list (i.e., head(..., n))
    warn.print = FALSE
)
```

### Argument finite
```{r}
info(
    data = vec1, 
    n = 1, # number of element to display per compartment of the output list (i.e., head(..., n))
    warn.print = FALSE
)
```

### All the arguments
```{r}
info(
    data = vec1, 
    n = 1, # number of element to display per compartment of the output list (i.e., head(..., n))
    warn.print = FALSE
)
```
